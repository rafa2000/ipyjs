# ipyjs
## Reproducible data driven documents with IPython and JavaScript
IPython can inject HTML content and Javascript code directly on a notebook. This, plus the the free production and interchange of JSON data between components and languates inside the same notebook, allows the use of third party JavaScript libraries &mdash;or any other scripting language&mdash; to enhance the **Reproducible** capabilities of your notebook.

Here are some unitary examples to help you mix and match some important JS libraries with your IPython notebooks:

* **`dynatable_in_ipython`** e Dynatable.js and Faker.js inside IPython example.

* **`higcharts_in_ipython`** Highchards.js inside IPython example.

* **`d3_in_ipython`** D3.js inside IPython example.
